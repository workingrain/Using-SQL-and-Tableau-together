#### DASHBOARD ALIGNMENT
The purpose and function of the dashboard align closely with the needs of the stakeholders interested in understanding mortality patterns and healthcare utilization across different demographics and regions. 
The Average Total Charges by Gender aims to understand the financial impact of healthcare services based on gender. This provides a clear comparison of the average total charges incurred by patients. Stakeholders can identify any disparities in healthcare costs between genders. The Services Utilization analyzes the utilization of different healthcare services. This presents a visual representation of service utilization through a pie chart. Stakeholders can quickly grasp the distribution of services utilized and identify any areas of high or low utilization. Prevalent Medical Conditions can identify the most common medical conditions. This ranks medical conditions by frequency, providing stakeholders with insights into prevalent health issues. The Leading Cause of Death helps to understand the primary causes of mortality. This allows stakeholders to prioritize areas for intervention based on the frequency of specific causes. The Leading Causes by State helps to explore the regional variations in mortality patterns. This enables stakeholders to understand regional disparities and tailor healthcare interventions accordingly. The Average Age-Adjusted Death Rate makes it easier to analyze trends in mortality rates over time. This provides a historical perspective on the death rate, which helps in the identification of trends and anomalies. The Most Utilized Service vs Leading Cause of Death per State investigates the relationship between service utilization and mortality patterns at the state level. This enables stakeholders to visualize how service utilization correlates with leading causes of death across different states. Stakeholders can identify the potential areas for healthcare resource allocation.
Overall, the dashboard serves as a comprehensive tool for stakeholders to gain insights and allow them to make informed decision-making and resource allocations based on data-driven insights. 
#### BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE TOOL
Tableau, the primary tool used for this analysis, is an ideal business intelligence tool for multiple reasons. 
Firstly, the tool has a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for users to create interactive visualizations and dashboards without requiring extensive technical expertise. The drag-and-drop functionality and intuitive design make it accessible to users across various skill levels. 
Furthermore, as seen in this analysis, Tableau offers seamless connectivity to various data sources such as PostgreSQL. More data sources also include databases, spreadsheets, and cloud services. This allows users to access and analyze data from multiple sources within a single platform. 
Lastly, Tableau provides a wide range of visualizations, including but not limited to bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, and maps. Users can create visually compelling and insightful visualizations to represent complex data in a clear and understandable format. 
#### DATA CLEANING
To clean the external dataset from the CDC, I used Python. First, I used exploratory data analysis to check the info(), head(), and is.null() to find the missing values in the dataset. I noticed that the column ‘113 Cause Name’ has values that are serial numbers in parentheses not necessary for the analysis. Using the re module, I removed the parentheses and the values inside the column ‘113 Cause Name’. Additionally, the external dataset has the states’ full names as opposed to the medical_data states that only have the state initials. My solution is to define a dictionary of state_initials that maps full state names to their respective state initials. Then, I added a new column, ‘State_initials,’ to the data frame based on the mapping done. Lastly, I removed rows where the ‘State’ column contained the value ‘United States’. This row was not necessary for the analysis and made the calculations incorrect.
Some minor cleaning for the internal dataset was done in pgAdmin4. First, I updated the gender column in the patient table. Every occurrence of Prefer not to answer was changed to Non-binary. Then, I corrected the column name of hignblood to highblood in the patient table. Lastly, I created a table for leading causes with the specified columns to store the external dataset. The columns match the fields in the external dataset to ensure compatibility when importing the data. 
#### DASHBOARD CREATION
The 1st dashboard consists of three sheets. Utilize multiple custom SQL queries to calculate the average overall charges incurred by patients (categorized by gender), the utilization numbers of different services provided to patients, and the frequency of prevalent medical conditions. Create a table visualization for average overall charges, a pie chart for the service utilization, and a bar chart for the prevalent medical conditions. After all sheets are made, combine them into the 1st dashboard. Make sure to add the labels and legends. 
The 2nd dashboard also consists of three sheets. Utilize multiple custom SQL queries to determine the top causes of death and their prevalence, determine the leading cause of death for each state, and calculate the average age-adjusted death rate over time. Create bar charts for the leading cause of death and leading cause by state and a line chart for the average age-adjusted death rate. After all sheets are made, combine them into the 2nd dashboard. Make sure to add the label and legends. 
The 3rd dashboard consists of only one sheet. Employ a custom SQL theory to explore the relationship between service utilization and leading causes of death. Create two maps, each representing one of the most utilized services (blood work and intravenous). Color-code the states on each map based on the leading cause of death. Include tooltips to display the state name, most utilized service, and leading cause of death when hovering over each state. Place this sheet into a 3rd dashboard. 
#### DATA ANALYSIS RESULTS
The analysis of the dashboards provides valuable insights into various aspects of healthcare and mortality trends.
The 1st dashboard is the KPI for the medical_data dataset. Firstly, the average total charges by gender reveal a significant difference in average total charges between genders, with non-binary individuals incurring the highest charges. This insight can help healthcare providers identify potential disparities in healthcare access and support efforts toward equitable healthcare provisions. Additionally, blood work emerges as the most utilized among patients in service utilization. This indicates its importance in diagnostic and preventive healthcare measures. This information is crucial for healthcare facilities to allocate resources effectively. In the prevalent medical conditions overweight emerges as the most prevalent medical condition among patients. This highlights the importance of addressing obesity-related health issues in healthcare strategies. 
The 2nd dashboard is the KPI for the external dataset, the leading_causes dataset. The leading cause of death is heart disease. The underscores the significance of cardiovascular health initiatives and interventions. Hospital leadership can use this information to prioritize funding and strategies to manage their heart disease. Moreover, the leading causes by state reveal regional variation in leading causes of death, with heart disease being predominant across most states. This insight can inform state-level public health policies, resource allocation, and intervention strategies tailored to address specific mortality trends within each region. The average age-adjusted death rate per year gradually declines over the years, indicating overall improvements in healthcare initiatives. This trend underscores the effectiveness of healthcare interventions and advancements in medical treatments. 
The last dashboard is the most utilized service versus the leading cause of death per state. This dashboard uses both the medical_data and leading_causes datasets. This dashboard highlights the correlation between the most utilized healthcare service and each state's leading cause of death. This insight can guide healthcare resource allocation and intervention strategies. This ensures that healthcare services are aligned with the predominant health needs and mortality trends in each state.
#### ANALYSIS LIMITATIONS
While the data analysis can provide valuable insights, it is essential to acknowledge some limitations that may affect the generalization of the findings. 
The datasets used in the analysis may not represent the entire population or healthcare landscape comprehensively. There could be inherent biases in the selection of patients, healthcare facilities, or regions included in the datasets. For example, if certain demographic groups or geographic areas are underrepresented in the data, the analysis results may not accurately reflect their utilization patterns or mortality trends. 
Furthermore, the analysis may not capture temporal changes in healthcare practices, policies, or demographics. Healthcare utilization patterns and mortality trends could evolve due to advancements in medical technology or shifts in population demographics. Without considering temporal changes, the analysis may provide a static snapshot that overlooks important dynamics over time. 
Lastly, the analysis may focus on specific aspects of healthcare utilization or mortality trends. This potentially overlooks systemic issues that influence population health outcomes. A comprehensive understanding of healthcare dynamics requires consideration of factors such as healthcare access, quality of care, and healthcare policies.
